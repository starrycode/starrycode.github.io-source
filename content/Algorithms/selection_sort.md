Social_Media_Description: It's hard to copy-and-paste rows of data out of PDF files. Try tabula-py to extract data into a CSV or Excel spreadsheet using a simple, easy-to-use interface.
IndexPreview: Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an <span style="font-size: 90% !important">$O(N^2)$</span> time complexity at all times. Effectively, the only reason that schools still teach selection sort is because it's an easy-to-understand, teachable technique, on the path to more complex and powerful algorithms.
