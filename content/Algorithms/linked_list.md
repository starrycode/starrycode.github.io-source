IndexPreview: Linked List is a linear data structure where elementsâ€™ data part & address part are stored separately. Each node inside a linked list is linked using pointers and addresses. If there is a loop inside a linked list, how can it be detected? And if a loop is detected, how can the start of the loop be identified?
