IndexPreview: Insertion sort is an in-place comparison-based algorithm. In the best case scenario, in which the array is nearly-sorted, it has <span style="font-size: 90% !important">$O(N)$</span> time complexity. In the worst case scenario, in which the array is reserve-sorted, it has <span style="font-size: 90% !important">$O(N^2)$</span> time complexity.
